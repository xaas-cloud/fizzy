This is a Rails engine that [37signals](https://37signals.com/) bundles with [Fizzy](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy) to offer the hosted version at https://fizzy.do.

## Development

To make Fizzy run in SaaS mode, run this in the terminal:

```ruby
bin/rails saas:enable
```

To can go back to open source mode:

```ruby
bin/rails saas:disable
```

Then you can work do [Fizzy development as usual](https://github.com/basecamp/fizzy).

## How to update Fizzy

After making changes to this gem, you need to update Fizzy to pick up the changes:

```ruby
BUNDLE_GEMFILE=Gemfile.saas bundle update --conservative fizzy-saas
```

## Environments

Fizzy is deployed with [Kamal](https://kamal-deploy.org/). You'll need to have the 1Password CLI set up in order to access the secrets that are used when deploying. Provided you have that, it should be as simple as `bin/kamal deploy` to the correct environment.
